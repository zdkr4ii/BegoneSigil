# BegoneSigil
An AHK script to sell my useless sigils and trade the vouchers back for more sigils, made for Granblue Fantasy: Relink.\
Script automatically stops when there are no more valid sigils to sell/trade (supposedly)

## Preparations
Head to Siero > "Transmute Sigils" > Make sure you have "Level 3" Highlighted\
Go back and Select "Trade Sigils" from "Knickknack vouchers" > Press Tab to open up the Sort page\
Navigate to the "Trade All" tab > Filter to your own choice\
Make sure you have the Equipped Tag not highlighted and that you are at the top of the filters list\
Close the window with Right click so that you are back on the sigil list\

My game settings, recommended if you dont wish to change anything in the script:\
Resolution: 1600:900\
Frame Rate: 60\
Screen Mode: Borderless\
Graphics Quality: Standard\
Brightness: 5/10\
Blur: Off\
Colorblind Support: Off

You may need to change the variable "spamtime" in line 13, 
depending on how long it usually takes for you to spend approx 999 vouchers (in milliseconds)
